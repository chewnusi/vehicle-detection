## Key Features

- **Military-Focused Detection** – Built to detect vehicles of military relevance (e.g., tanks, APCs, armored trucks) rather than general civilian vehicles.
- **Real-Time Processing** – Handles live video streams via RTSP with efficient performance.
- **Deep Learning–Powered Detection** – Utilizes an AI model trained specifically for military vehicle classes.
- **Multi-Object Tracking** – Assigns consistent IDs to each military vehicle across frames, enabling trajectory tracing.
- **Flexible Input Sources** – Compatible with local video files and live RTSP streams.
- **Modular Architecture** – Cleanly separated modules for core application logic, configuration, and worker processes—ideal for extension and maintenance.
